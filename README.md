getguide
========



`getguide` script - opens new tab in web browser <br>
and shows direct links. <br>
on the needed guides. It helps me in my day by day routine. 

Does not require any side libraries. Tested on my machine :<br>
```echo -e "$(python -V)$(python3 -V)\n"
Python 2.7.6
Python 3.4.0
```
