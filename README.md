getguide
========



getguide script - opens new tab in the web browser
and shows direct links on the needed guides. It helps me in my day-to-day routine. 

Requires one side library `requests` : 
```bash
$pip install requests
```


Tested on my machine :<br>
```bash
echo -e "$(python -V)$(python3 -V)\n"
Python 2.7.6
Python 3.4.0
```
